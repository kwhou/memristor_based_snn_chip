# Memristor-Based SNN Chip

![NTHU LARC Logo](images/nthu_larc_logo.png?raw=true)

This repository contains the RTL verilog code for the digital part of a memristor-based SNN chip. The analog part, which is the memristor-based compute-in-memory (CIM) macro, are represented by a behavior model.

## Usage

1. Run verilog simulation
```
$ make sim
```

2. Clean working directory
```
$ make clean
```
